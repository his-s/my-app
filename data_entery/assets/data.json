Tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) may be an indication of certain respiratory issues.\n\n2. **Pulse:**\n   - Assess the pulse rate. An abnormal pulse may suggest cardiovascular or other systemic issues.\n\n3. **Blood Pressure:**\n   - Measure blood pressure. Note that caution should be taken not to decrease blood pressure before a CT scan, as it might affect the results.\n\n4. **Temperature:**\n   - Check the patient's body temperature. Elevated temperatures may indicate an infection or other underlying issues.\n\n#### Head Examination\n\n1. **Facial Asymmetry:**\n   - Examine the face for any signs of asymmetry, which may include:\n     - Drop in the angle of the mouth.\n     - Mouth deviated to one side.\n     - Inability to blow out a cheek.![Facial Asymmetry](https://www.iracdubai.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Best-Neuromuscular-Physiotherapist.jpg)"

Note any abnormal sounds such as crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds.\n\n2. **Heart Sounds:**\n   - Listen to the heart sounds at different auscultatory areas (e.g., mitral, tricuspid, aortic, pulmonary). Identify and document any abnormalities, such as murmurs, irregular rhythms, or extra heart sounds.\n\n3. **Palpation of the Chest:**\n   - Palpate the chest for tenderness, masses, or deformities.\n\n4. **Palpation of the Heart:**\n   - Palpate the precordium to assess for any tenderness, thrills, or abnormal pulsations.\n\n5. **Chest Expansion:**\n   - Assess chest expansion by placing hands on the chest and observe for symmetrical movement during breathing.\n\n6. **Fremitus:**\n   - Evaluate tactile fremitus by placing hands on the chest and asking the patient to repeat a phrase. Check for symmetry and intensity of vibrations."
